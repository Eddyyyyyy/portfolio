                        Amotions is a early-stage startup that is developing a dashboard webapp and is looking to launch an MVP in late July 2022. My responsibility was designing the skill practice userflow. During the process, I solved design challenges and team feedback obstacles.

                    Amotions offers managers and their teams soft-skills coaching from world-class experts. The skill-learning industry is growing at a rapid rate because employers and executives are realizing that investing into their employees is essential for company growth and are scrambling to find platforms that fit their needs.

                <h1>I had the responsibility of designing the practice flow due to the quality of my redesign of the blueprint.</h1>
                <p>
                    My take-home assignment was to redesign the practice home screen of the dashboard webapp. Even though I asked the founder several questions regarding the functionalities and expectations, I knew I didn’t have all the data I needed so I focused on the UI only.
                </p>

                <h2>Existing User Research</h2>
                <h1>Before I arrived, the Founder had interviewed 5 managers and other executives from various companies.</h1>
                <p>
                    When I became an employee at the company, I was inundated with information such as the product spec and research notes. Before I jumped into designing again, I needed to understand the customer fully. That meant taking a detailed read into all existing user research.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/amotions/existingResearch.png" class="portImg"/>

                <p>
                    To understand the customer’s needs, I created a persona that reflected the research. I showed the persona to the team to ensure that I was on the same page as everyone else. Additionally, this step came in handy when I had to create a <span class="caseLink"><a href="#mapping" class="textGrad bold">journey map</a></span> that simulated the customer’s experience.

                <h2>Userflow</h2>
                <h1>To understand the functionality of the feature, I created a userflow based on the product spec.</h1>
                <p>
                    The flow diagram starts when the user enters the practice home page and ends when the user doesn’t require the services of the feature anymore. The core functionalities of the flow include:

                    <li>- Allowing people to do practice sets (groups of thought-provoking questions)</li>
                    <li>- Being able to explore all the skills that the product has to offer</li>

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <h1>I began creating the mockups for the flow. However, I couldn’t get my practice home design past the team.</h1>
                <p>
                    After taking the product spec and user research into account, I had to change many elements of my take-home assessment version of the practice home page. When I presented my version one to the team, I was met with criticism and after spending the whole meeting defending my design choices, I ultimately had to change the design. Version two and three had the same outcome and I felt lost.
                </p>
                <ul class="listRemove">
                    <li>- Version 1: “Horizontal scroll might not be accessible to users of all digital experience levels”</li>
                    <li>- Version 2: “Big block of content on the left is awkward”</li>
                    <li>- Version 3: “This screen is just so busy”</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./img/amotions/pracHomeVersions.png" class="portImg spaceBelow"/>
                <h1>The type of feedback I was getting from the team was the cause of the challenge.</h1>
                <p>
                    Prior to designing, I stated to the team that I welcomed feedback on my designs so I could iterate. Yet, I gave no thought to what I meant by feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought statements like: “I think that’s awkward” or “It needs to look better” was good feedback but attempting to address those statements led me on wild tangents. As a result, I was caught in a cycle that stalled the design.
                </p>

                <h2>My Actions</h2>
                <h1>The deadline was arriving fast. I first tackled my communcation during feedback sessions.</h1>
                <p>
                    It was the first week of July 2022. I had about 3 weeks to get the team’s approval for the mockups in the practice userflow, so the developers can start developing the product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started by telling my team that the feedback I’m getting is not helping me. In the following feedback sessions, I spoke up when I didn’t know EXACTLY what my teammates were trying to articulate. By doing that, I had gotten myself out of the cycle!
                </p>
                <img src="./img/amotions/gettingOut.png" class="portImg spaceBelow"/>
                <h1>Secondly, I addressed the lack of customer feedback by getting permission to interview people that I knew.</h1>
                <p>
                    Because of all the design assumptions that I was inevidably making, I wanted to get our potential client’s thoughts on what I was designing. However, due to the company’s circumstances, I was denied that request.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn’t want to end it there and got the team’s permission to get feedback from my friends and mentors from outside the company by making the point that those people might be the employees who are using our platform because their managers introduced it to them.

                <p>
                    The overall flow was standard and easy to understand so most of the feedback focused on the practice home screen itself.

                    Although I couldn’t get access to our target demographic, I still needed to account for them.

                <p>
                    The fact that all 7 people I interviewed didn’t know what to do first when they saw the practice home was alarming. If customers don’t know where to begin, they wouldn’t care about doing the practices at all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Customers are supposed to start with the daily practices and then transition to doing some of their chosen skills of focus. If people have time, they would browse the other skills that Amotions has to offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, I kept the UI as focused as possible by using 2-3 font sizes and not overwhelming the user with too many images and interactions.

                <p><span class="amotionsAction bold">Action:</span> <br/> I created a more flexible layout that would allow for longer practice set titles and a more pleasant UI.</p>

                <h2>Impact Of The Iterations</h2>
                <h1>Over the course of 2 weeks, user retention rose by 400%.</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to better product navigation, customers were able to view more content, which prompted more interest in the company and thus, customers were more willing to go into the app to see what changed, since there were weekly changes being added to the product.

                <h2>Future Of The Company</h2>
                <h1>More usability testing and product iterations.</h1>
                <p>
                    When I left the company in preparation for a heavy college workload, the company only completed its first round of MVP iterations. There will be more sessions planned in the future. Those sessions will not only test the practice flow that I took the lead on, but also the other features of the dashboard webapp that my fellow designers created. After every round, comes product iterations, which will make the product better and better!

                <h1>I learned to communicate my concerns and encourage the team to participate in the design process.</h1>
                <p>
                    As a designer, I will be participating in more design feedback sessions in the future. This experience has <span class="caseLink"><a href="#challenge" class="textGrad bold">challenged</a></span> me and given me a taste of what's to come. And I learned that I needed to be open and speak up if the feedback pushed me in the wrong direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, everyone on the team has a part to play and it is my job as a designer to get everyone involved. 
                    The skill of communicating ideas to non-designers is important. 
                    By including people, I was able to improve the product.
