                    Amotions offers managers and their teams soft-skill coaching from world-class experts. Currently, the company has 1000+ paying and interested customers and 15+ world-class coaches. The company is primed for success because, according to <span class="caseLink"><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soft-skills-training-market---44-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-americacorporate-segment-to-be-significant-for-revenue-generation17000-technavio-reports-301505650.html" target="_blank" class="textGrad bold">PRNewswire</a></span>, the skill-learning industry is rapidly growing.

                <h1>A dashboard is needed to give the company the ability to offer a personalized experience to the customers.</h1>
                <p>
                    Amotions wants to develop a dashboard where people can learn skills, receive coaching, watch educational content, and track progress because they want to offer customers a personalized experience.

                    To understand the customer base better, information such as the product spec and research notes needed to be analyzed.

                    I qualitatively coded the research notes and created a persona that reflected the research. Additionally, this step came in handy when I had to visualize a <span class="caseLink"><a href="#mapping" class="textGrad bold">journey map</a></span> that simulated the customer’s experience.

                    The flow diagram starts when the user enters the practice home page and ends when the user doesn’t require the services of the feature anymore. The core functionalities of the flow include:

                <h1>I began creating mockups for the flow. However, I couldn’t get my practice home design past the team.</h1>
                <p>
                    When I presented my version one to the team, I had objections, and after spending the whole meeting defending my design choices, I ultimately had to change the design. Versions two and three had the same outcome, and I felt lost.
                </p>
                <ul class="listRemove">
                    <li>Version 1: “Horizontal scroll widget is impractical.”</li>
                    <li>Version 2: “Big block of content on the left seems awkward.”</li>
                    <li>Version 3: “This screen overall is busy.”</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="./img/amotions/pracHomeVersions.png" class="portImg spaceBelow"/>
                <h1>The cause of the challenge was me because I wasn’t attentive to the feedback I got and assumed I knew what to iterate.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before designing, I welcomed team feedback on my designs so I could iterate. Yet, I gave no thought to what I meant by feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I thought statements like: “I think that’s awkward” or “It needs to look better” was good feedback, but assuming what my team wanted and addressing those statements led me on wild tangents. As a result, I was caught in a cycle that stalled the design.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/amotions/feedbackCycle.png" class="portImg"/>

                <h2>My Actions</h2>
                <h1>The deadline was arriving fast. I focused on tackling my communication challenges during feedback sessions.</h1>
                <p>
                    It was the first week of July 2022. I had 3 weeks to get the team’s approval for the mockups in the practice userflow. There was pressure to finish before the deadline because the development team needed as much time before the MVP launch date as possible to finish coding everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I told my team that the team feedback wasn't what I had in mind. Thus, during the next feedback session, I spoke up and asked follow-up questions when I didn’t know what my teammates were trying to articulate. By doing that, I got out of the cycle!
                </p>
                <img src="./img/amotions/gettingOut.png" class="portImg spaceBelow"/>
                <h1>As a result of asking questions and being open with my team, I uncovered insights about the practice home and received suggestions.</h1>
                <p>
                    I took the practice home screen to my team and asked for guidance. Although some pieces of advice were surface-level, it still ensured that my team and I were on the same page and could work towards a solution.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/amotions/feedback.png" class="portImg"/>
                <p class="bold">
                    Here was the team consensus:

                <ul class="listRemove">
                    <li>Images on top of images meant messy textures</li>

                <h2>Journey Mapping</h2>
                <h1>Due to client feedback restrictions, my team and I visualized the pain points managers might face if they were using my current mockups.</h1>
                <p>
                    Because of all the design assumptions, I wanted to get our client’s thoughts on what I was designing. However, due to the company’s circumstances, that request got denied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I couldn’t get access to our target demographic, I still needed to account for them. Thus, during the next team meeting, I worked with my team to walk through my mockups step-by-step using the <span class="caseLink"><a href="#persona" class="textGrad bold">persona</a></span> I created.

                    Customers are supposed to start with the daily practices and then transition to doing some of their chosen skills of focus. If people have time, they can browse other skills that Amotions offers.

                <p>
                    Additionally, I kept the UI as focused as possible by using 2-3 font sizes and not overwhelming the user with too many images and interactions.

                <h2>Impact Of The Iterations</h2>
                <h1>Over 2 weeks, user retention rose by 400%.</h1>
                <p>
                    Due to better product navigation, customers could view more content, prompting more interest in the company. Thus, customers were more willing to go into the app to see product updates.

                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <h1>Since the dashboard is a responsive product, I also designed mobile versions of important screens of the flow.</h1>
                <p>
                    By simulating the element layout on a smaller screen, I give developers insight into how the product should look and lessen their cognitive load.

                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    Ultimately, I chose to showcase the desktop version of the product in this case study because the company knows that most people would use the platform on a desktop screen.

                <h2>Future Of The Company</h2>
                <h1>More usability testing and product iterations will follow.</h1>
                <p>
                    When I left the company in preparation for a heavy college workload, the company completed its first round of MVP iterations. 
                    There are more sessions planned in the future. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those sessions will test the practice flow and the other features of the dashboard web app that my fellow designers created. 
                    Every round of usability testing leads to product iterations, which makes the product better and better!

                <h2>Reflections</h2>
                <h1>I learned to communicate my concerns and encourage the team to participate in the design process.</h1>
                <p>
                    As a designer, I will be participating in more design feedback sessions in the future. This experience has <span class="caseLink"><a href="#challenge" class="textGrad bold">challenged</a></span> me and given me a taste of what's to come. And I learned that I needed to be open and speak up if the feedback pushed me in the wrong direction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, everyone on the team has a part to play, and it is my job as a designer to get everyone involved. The skill of communicating ideas to non-designers is crucial for success. By including people, I was able to improve the product.
