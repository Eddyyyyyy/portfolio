                <h1>“Competitive Mental Health” is harming UDub students.</h1>
                <p>
                    In an unrelated course project, I was interviewing a counselor who works for the University of Washington (UW). I knew from research that the pandemic has been rough on students. However, I was shocked when I learned the desperation of the situation. The counselor said:
                </p>
                <p class="tunnelProb bold">
                    “The student to counselor ratio is growing further apart everyday. Because of this, we have to prioritize the most severe cases.”

                <h1>Most students have mild cases but that can’t be ignored.</h1>
                <p>
                    I couldn’t help but think about how some students have to be excluded because their feelings aren’t severe enough. Most, if not all, students have experienced some form of stress and depressive feelings. If these feelings aren’t acknoledged, it can lead ot severe consequences. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some problems and feelings that contributed to the poor mental health of UDub students. The results are sourced from mental wellness surveys I did for recent course projects.

                    Before I started researching the mental health space, I knew of many solutions. This time, I examined them from a pros versus cons perspective to find out what these solutions did that worked and what was lacking. I assessed many solutions, but I focused on two because they were the most established.

                    The solution needs to cater to most (if not all) UDub students and a solution that is made by UDub students is not enough. How can my solution empathize with UDub students’ problems?

                    Visibility is a key factor in a solution’s success. If it is just another generic solution, it would be swallowed up along with the other similar solutions.

                    What’s the point of putting effort into a solution that would remain conceptual? My solution needs to be do-able by a small team with a limited budget in as timely a manner as possible.

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <h1>The storytelling platform solution is a perfect match!</h1>
                <p>
                    I will design and develop a website that showcases stories told by UDub students. Being one of the few solutions that has the potential to address all the common mental struggles that students have, a storytelling platform can introduce perspective and personal connection to a large population of students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are little to no storytelling websites that focus on the college student experience let alone a solution that caters solely to UDub students. By telling stories in a visual and interactive way, the solution would quickly gain momentum. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of feasibility, the solution is a read-only platform. As such, it ishould be managable with just a small team of dedicated individuals.

                    I told friends and mutual friends (designers and developers) about my solution and got them on board. Coincidentally, there was a hackathon occuring over the weekend and it was the perfect opportunity to jumpstart the website solution and build team synergy.

                <p>
                    To be clear, my team and I did not win the hackathon because we didn’t create a solution that directly addressed the given topic. I say we won because I learned how my teammates operated and realized what needed to change about the current solution. That is more valuable than any prize the hackathon offered. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I led my team on the design and concept. Our final product was a website that showcased the stories of UDub students. There was no need to have a user account function because I wanted efficiency. Readers go on the website, read stories, and then leave with a new perspective.

                <h2>Post-hackathon Analysis</h2>
                <h1>Among other issues, quantity is prioritized over quality.</h1>
                <p>
                    The following week after the hackathon event ended, my team and I met to address the current state of the project. One talking point was the story submission process that we came up with for the prototype. 
                </p>
                <img src="./img/tunnel/firstProductProcess.svg" class="portImg">
                <p>This model poses a few concerns:</p>
                <ul class="listRemove">
                    <li>- Why would anyone spend the time to tell their story? What’s in it for them?</li>
                    <li>- What would happen if no one submits their stories? </li>
                    <li>- When would be the cut-off for a user to reply to the email I sent them? What if they don’t reply?</li>
                    <li>- How would I compensate users who spend the time telling their story in a Zoom call?</li>
                    <li class="bold">- Where would the “rejected” stories go?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The last point is most concerning to me. Assuming many students want their stories to be featured on the platform, it would mean the platform would have a lot of stories. Having too many stories make the platform hard to manage especially when I want to tell those stories in a visual and interactive manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One way to preserve the quality over quantity is to say “no” to some students. I very much dislike that method because by saying “no,” I am inferring that some stories are not good enough to be featured and that would be displeasing to many students.

                <h1>Solution: gather student experiences and tell a story.</h1>
                <p>
                    If my team and I become the storytellers, we can gather student experiences that relate to a theme such a loneliness or imposter syndrome and use that research to shape the story. Because the story is a logical combination of student experiences, I would tell the story through the lense of personas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By representing many experiences in several or so stories, the platform becomes managable and my team and I can focus on quality over quantity.

                    The majority of the website is off-white and full black. Full black symbolizes the darkness that hides itself in Student’s minds. While the off-white symbolizes the light that drives out the darkness. I use this symbolism to keep the UI as minimal as possible so it would not detract from the featured stories.

                <h1>Onboarding, homepage, and one story takes priority.</h1>
                <p>
                    The onboarding creates a nice first impression on readers which would build retention. The homepage is important because it displays all the stories. Of course, it wouldn’t be a storytelling platform without any stories, so having at least one story to show would give students a sense of what we are aiming to do. I aim to launch the MVP during Q4 2022 (sometime during October).

                <p>
                    The website tells relatable stories that enrich UDub students. As such, researching the stories’ impact on UDub students is important. At the end of every story, there will be a feedback screen where students can give their thoughts on the story annonymously.

                    I'm currently working with developers to make the transition from prototype to a fully-functioning product. 
                    At the same time, I'm putting together tunnelvzn's first story by synthesizing the 19 experiences that we have gotten through student interviews.

                <p>
                    If the progression rate is maintained, we would meet the MVP launch deadline of Q4 2022. Post-launch, I will promote it on my university’s Discord and Reddit. After which, my team and I will monitor the impact of the first story and make adjustments where necessary.

                    Looking back, the project has come a long way. If team members weren’t comfortable expressing their ideas (no matter how crazy they seem), this project have ended after the hackathon event concluded. I give my teammates’ ideas time to shine so everyone can discuss and come to a conclusion. The project isn’t a one-man show. It is a team effort.
