                <h1>Due to time and forgetfulness, Candy-loving Redditors struggle to reunite with their favorite products.</h1>
                <p>
                    I visit Candy-focused SubReddits (such as r/candy and r/chocolate) a lot. Every time I do, I see Redditors asking if anyone knew about their forgotten candies after belting out the bits of information they retain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a fellow candy-lover, I try to guess what some people are searching for but it isn’t what they are looking for. When given a vague description, there is only so much you could do.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <h1>I sent surveys to understand how many Redditors experienced candy forgetfulness.</h1>
                <p>
                    To get rid of the doubts in our minds that these were isolated cases, I sent surveys to both the r/candy and r/chocolate subreddits to understand the scale of the problem. I wanted to see the percentage of Redditors who struggled to relocate their favorite products due to the limited information they remember.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/candyStats.svg" class="portImg spaceBelow">
                <h1>Ook... a chunk of the community. Time to go in depth by interviewing 9 Redditors!</h1>
                <p>
                    With my teammate, I interviewed 9 members of the r/candy community who indicated on the survey that they have experienced the problem. All interviews were done through direct message.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was interested in the cause of the forgetfulness, the motive for reuniting with the candy, and what people would do after they found the product. Below is the results summary.
                </p>

                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                <h1>A new lead: interviewees regularly use candy news sites.</h1>
                <p>
                    I conducted SWOT analysis on three products my interviewees used: Confectionery News, Candy Industry, and Candy Gurus. Some major findings included the fact that these news platforms have a loyal following (facilitated by newsletters), but no way to help people find their forgotten products.

                <h1>Include industry news for convenience? Let’s think about it!</h1>
                <p>
                    My teammate suggested that we add a news feature to the solution. Originally, I was opposed the idea because there were other existing products that did that. However, I’ve learned (through interviews) that people want to learn more about the candy they have just been reunited with. It would be convienient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what else should the product do? With my teammate, I brainstormed relevant features based on our research and filtered them through the feasibility and practicality lenses.

                <p>
                    In addition to a search engine that would interpret vague user descriptions, the solution would also give Candy-loving Redditors relevant news pertaining both to their curiosity of their newly reunited candy and the industry in general. The solution would be in the form of a website for easy access.

                    I used mockflow to quickly visualize my initial ideas so I can communicate my vision for the product to my teammate. After presenting our reasonings and came to a consenses, I worked on the wireframe with my teammate.

                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    I had trouble reaching out to members of the subreddits. Thus, I talked to candy-loving aquaintances. They thought the screens looked good and suggested minor changes. However, there was two major comments made by the candy-lovers that I thought stood out.
                </p>
                <h1>Search Tool Page: “Reminds me of the doctor’s office.”</h1>
                <p>
                    All 5 candy-lovers stated that the candy search tool page looked like a form at the clinic. Most thought all the fields were required and expressed concern if they couldn’t give an answer to one of the inputs.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/newsWire.png" class="portImg spaceBelow">
                <h1>Home Page: “Top five list is boring AND overwhelming.”</h1>
                <p>
                    4 candy-lovers felt the use of an accordion for the top five list was misused. If all dropdowns are closed, it would be boring. However, if all dropdowns were opened, it would be overwhelming to new site visitors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With my fellow designer, I analyzed the feedback. Talking to these candy-lovers opened my mind. Looking at the screens with a new perspective, I agreed with the feedback. Thus, I set out to address them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had placed too much burden on users with the search tool. They have to go through a boring process to see results. Many inputs and UI elements (such as optional fields and input formatting guides) were missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list on the homepage forced users to click elements that would drop a ton of information onto the screen and that gets annoying quickly.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <h1>Search tool was straight forward to fix. The list was not.</h1>
                <p>
                    The search tool was a matter of putting less burden on users and implementing less user input boxes. My execution of the search tool would be covered in the <span class="caseLink"><a href="#prototype" class="textGrad bold">prototyping section</a></span> and in more detail.

                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    The challenge was redesigning the top 5 list. Here is how it went:
                </p>
                <h1>Stage 1: Removing the unnecessary 😎.</h1>
                <p>
                    To address the overwhelming portion of the feedback, I decided to remove the accordion and simplify the content. This was what needed to go:
                </p>
                <ul class="listRemove spaceBelow">
                    <li>- Places to buy: not needed at the moment</li>
                    <li>- Link to more info: clicking image or product name works</li>
                    <li>- Candy description: users can go to the info page if they need to</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Stage 2: Experiment with what is left 🤔.</h1>
                <p>
                    Here is what is left: Candy name, rank, and image. Below are the ideas I experimented with.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/designBlock.svg" class="portImg">
                <h1>Stage 3: Face the all-mighty design-block 😭.</h1>
                <p>
                    When my teammate and I got stuck on the UI design, we thought about scrapping the list entirely. I insisted on keeping it because it gave the product an up-to-date feeling which increases credibility. Our product helps candy-loving redditors find candy and trust goes a long way when users feel lost in their search.
                </p>
                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    We had to commit on the list idea and design a layout that worked.
                </p>
                <h1>Stage 4: I’m on to something 😮... Billboard.com.</h1>
                <p>
                    With no other options, I began to seek out existing products that have lists. Of course, the first things that come to mind when looking for lists that rank things is music and movies. I eventually landed on Billboard.com and their HOT 100 list. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I quickly drew the connections between it and the challenge that I am trying to solve.

                    I took a note from other candy news sites by using a newsletter CTA in the carousel. Below that is the Billboard.com inspired list design. Although I made the list wider to give information more breathing room, there was still leftover space. So, I added a blurb that gave credibility to the list.

                    Thinking back, the idea of embedding images into the row of the list was not completely new to me, I didn’t think it would work in my project. In my mind, the images would appear way too small. When I had exhausted all my other ideas, I didn’t think to try it and got stuck.

                    Going forward, the first thing I would do is to look at how other products are implementing their designs and learn from them. Next, when I go into ideation, nothing is off the table. Every idea needs to be tried out no matter how bad it may seem in my head.

                <h1>More time? I would get Candy Redditors to test the site.</h1>
                <p>
                    Excluding the surveys and interviews, I couldn’t get the members of the candy community involved because usability testing takes more involvement and my design partner and I didn’t have sufficient funds to provide an incentive that would motivate people to spend time with us.

                    I am designing for Candy Redditors. While our aquaintances are similar to Candy Redditors, there is still bias involved.
