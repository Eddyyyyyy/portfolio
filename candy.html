                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                <h1>Due to time and forgetfulness, Candy-loving Redditors struggled to reunite with their favorite products.</h1>
                <p>
                    I visit Candy-focused SubReddits (such as r/candy and r/chocolate) a lot. Every time I do, I see Redditors asking if anyone knew about their forgotten candies after belting out the bits of information they retain.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a fellow candy-lover, I try to guess what people are searching for, but it isn’t the answer they had in mind. When given a vague description, there is little I can do.              
                </p>

            <div class="sec" id="research">
                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <h1>I sent surveys to understand how many Redditors experienced candy forgetfulness.</h1>
                <p>
                    I sent surveys to both the r/candy and r/chocolate subreddits to understand the scale of the problem. I wanted to see the percentage of Redditors who struggled to relocate their favorite products due to the limited information they remember.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/candyStats.svg" class="portImg spaceBelow">
                <h1>Ook! A chunk of the community. Time to go in depth by interviewing 9 Redditors!</h1>
                <p>
                    With my teammate, I interviewed nine members of the r/candy community who indicated on the survey that they had the problem. All interviews were through direct messages.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was interested in the cause of the forgetfulness, the motive for reuniting with the candy, and what people would do after they found the product. Below is the results summary.
                </p>

                <h2>Market Research</h2>
                <h1>A new lead: interviewees regularly use candy news sites.</h1>
                <p>
                    I conducted a SWOT analysis on three products my interviewees used: Confectionery News, Candy Industry, and Candy Gurus. Some findings included the existence of these news platforms having a loyal following (facilitated by newsletters). However, these competitors couldn’t help people find their forgotten products.                
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/candyCompAnalysis.png" class="portImg">

                <h2>Solutions Ideation</h2>
                <h1>Include industry news for convenience.</h1>
                <p>
                    My teammate suggested adding a “news” feature to the solution. I opposed the idea because other existing products did that. However, I’ve learned (through interviews) that people want to learn more about the candy they have found. It would be convenient.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    But what else should the product do? With my teammate, I brainstormed relevant features based on our research and filtered them through the feasibility and practicality lenses.                
                </p>

                <h1>The search and news feature address problems and user needs.</h1>
                <p>
                    In addition to a search engine that would interpret vague user descriptions, the solution would also give Candy-loving Redditors relevant news about their newly reunited candy and the industry. It would be in the form of a website for easy access.

                    I used mockflow for quick idea visualization. We sketched separately to avoid group thinking. After presenting our reasonings and reaching a consensus, I worked on the wireframe with my teammate.

                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    I struggled with reaching out to members of the subreddits. Thus, I talked to candy-loving acquaintances. They thought the screens looked good and suggested minor changes. However, there were two comments made that stood out.                
                </p>
                <h1>Search Tool Page: “Reminds me of the doctor’s office.”</h1>
                <p>
                    All 5 candy lovers stated that the candy search tool page looked like a form at the clinic. Most thought all the fields were required and expressed concern if they couldn’t answer one of the inputs.
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/newsWire.png" class="portImg spaceBelow">
                <h1>Home Page: “Top five list is boring AND overwhelming.”</h1>
                <p>
                    4 candy lovers felt using an accordion for the top five list was misplaced. If all dropdowns are closed, it would be boring. However, revealing all dropdowns would be overwhelming to new site visitors.                
                </p>

                <p>
                    With my fellow designer, I analyzed the feedback. I looked at the screens with a fresh perspective.               
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had placed too much burden on users with the search tool. People had to go through a tedious process to see results. Many inputs and UI elements (such as optional fields and input formatting guides) were missing.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, the list on the homepage forced users to click elements that would drop a ton of information onto the screen, making it annoying.                
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sec">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <h1>The search tool was straightforward to fix, but the list wasn’t.</h1>
                <p>
                    The search tool was a matter of putting less burden on users and implementing fewer user input boxes. The <span class="caseLink"><a class="textGrad underlinedLink bold" href="#prototype">prototyping section</a></span> will cover the search tool in more detail.
                </p>
                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    The challenge was redesigning the top 5 list. Here is how it went:
                </p>
                <h1>Stage 1: Removing the unnecessary 😎.</h1>
                <p>
                    To address the overwhelming portion of the feedback, I decided to remove the accordion and simplify the content. Here was what needed to go:                
                </p>
                <ul class="listRemove spaceBelow">
                    <li>Places to buy: unneeded at the moment</li>
                    <li>Link to more info: clicking the image or product name works</li>
                    <li>Candy Description: users can go to the info page if they need to</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Stage 2: Experiment with what is left 🤔.</h1>
                <p>
                    Here is what is left: candy name, rank, and image. I experimented with the below ideas.                
                </p>
                <img src="./img/candy/designBlock.svg" class="portImg">
                <h1>Stage 3: Face the all-mighty design block 😭.</h1>
                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    When my teammate and I got stuck on the UI design, we thought about scrapping the list entirely. I insisted on keeping it because it gave the product an up-to-date feeling. Our product helps candy-loving Redditors find candy, and trust goes a long way when users feel lost in their search. We had to commit to the list idea and design a layout that worked.                
                </p>
                <h1>Stage 4: I’m on to something 😮... Billboard.com.</h1>
                <p>
                    I began to explore existing products that had list elements once I had no other options available. Of course, the first things that come to mind when looking for lists that rank things are music and movies. I eventually landed on Billboard.com and their HOT 100 list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I quickly drew the connections between it and the challenge.

                <p>
                    I took a note from other candy news sites and used a newsletter CTA in the carousel. Below that is the Billboard-inspired list design. Although I widened the list to give information more breathing room, there was still leftover space. So, I added a blurb that gave credibility to the list.

                <h1>Design-block? Don’t be afraid to try skeptical ideas!</h1>
                <p>
                    Thinking back, embedding images into the list was familiar to me. I didn’t think it would work for my project. In my mind, the visuals would appear way too small. When I had exhausted all my other ideas, I didn’t think to try them and got stuck.                
                </p>
                <p class="spaceBelow">
                    In the future, I will look at how other products implement their designs and learn from them. Next, when I ideate, nothing is off the table. I will attempt all ideas before I decide to throw them out.                
                </p>
                <h1>More time? I would get Candy Redditors to test the site.</h1>
                <p>
                    Excluding the surveys and interviews, I couldn’t get the members of the candy community involved because usability testing takes more involvement, and my design partner and I didn’t have sufficient funds to provide an incentive to motivate people to spend time with us. While our acquaintances are similar to Candy Redditors, bias is still involved because I know them.
