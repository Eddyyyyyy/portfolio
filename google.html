                <p>
                    As the culmination of my time at the University of Washington Information School, I collaborated with Google through a six-month contract. Google provided me and my team with technical resources, problem space information, and time with stakeholders (Google employees). My team and I drove the software development process and timeline.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <h1>
                    The project focused on reducing the number of duplicate bug reports through Android's Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) by 30%.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The VRP is an existing platform where people can report bugs (bug reporters) for a monetary reward. Android Security Analysts assess the reports for validity and severity. However, <a class="underlinedLink" href="https://bughunters.google.com/learn/invalid-reports/5374985771941888/about-this-section" target="_blank">90% of submitted reports are false positives</a>, and many of those are duplicates. Through the project, Android Security hoped to reduce duplicates by 30% (seen as a realistic benchmark).

                <h2>Success</h2>
                <h1>
                    Google must receive a working full-stack solution that meets the requested deduplication benchmarks and be on track throughout the six months.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The project will be a trailblazer for Android Security. Thus, a working proof of concept has to be delivered. Ideally, the solution should meet the set duplication reduction benchmark of 30%. Throughout the project, the team must adapt to unexpected changes while keeping the solution on track to completion and provide Google with milestone updates & presentations.

                    The current VRP's bug reporting form does not identify duplicate reports, costing Google's and Bug Reporters' time.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The form ensures that submissions are well-structured and contain the necessary information. Bug reporters must invest considerable time in submitting high-quality reports to receive rewards. Unfortunately, the form does not notify reporters that their report is a duplicate submission during filing; only Android Security Analysts discover the report is a duplicate later. This results in wasted time for everyone involved.

                <p>
                    From ideation and wireframing to validation and engineering, I built a solution with my team that harnesses ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo to calculate bug report similarity data based on the user's input and other Bug Reporters' submitted reports. The AI-driven feature is incorporated into the original VRP userflow and thus follows the VRP's design style.

                <p>
                    After reviewing the team's findings, we gained two insights. First, AI's effectiveness is limited by the quality of its training data, highlighting the need to clean Google's data to avoid garbage in and out. The second insight was to enhance human-AI collaboration by ensuring transparency and explainability. Many AI systems are black boxes, so our solution must be clear and understandable to foster trust and cooperation.

                <h2>Design: Mid-Fi Wireframes</h2>
                <h1>
                    To eliminate perfectionism while maintaining appeal to sponsors during the upcoming presentation, I introduced the usage of mid-fidelity wireframes.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    A consensus was formed between me and my design teammate, following the low-fidelity wireframes, leading to concrete design specifications. We both felt it was time to collaborate on a design reflecting the actual UI. However, we were not ready to go into the highest fidelity of design yet because elements less essential to this stage (like color, spacing, and sizing) were being obsessed over.

                    My team and I presented the design to Google engineers and cybersecurity professionals, receiving valuable feedback on user experience and technical feasibility. Our sponsors were particularly interested in understanding the AI model's criteria for determining report similarity. After reviewing Android's security rules for bug report triaging, my team and I selected three based on feasibility and integrated them into the comparison screen.

However, we connected with key professionals, including an engineer who worked on AWS's bug reporting experience. After refining the mid-fidelity wireframes, we developed a prototype. Feedback highlighted the importance of allowing Bug Reporters to export similar reports in their preferred format for independent analysis.

                <p>
                    I worked with my team to assess the effectiveness of our solution by selecting a sample of 10 duplicate bug reports for testing. To evaluate the accuracy, I put the sample into our solution to see the amount identified as duplicates by the AI. 4/10 (40%) were marked duplicates based on a 75% or higher similarity score, surpassing expectations. I also recorded the AI's deduplication time to measure its speed compared to human reviewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To measure the AI's agreement with human reviewers (Inter-Rater Reliability), we used Cohen's Kappa. Since the triaged reports didn't specify the determiners used by our solution, we provided 10 reports to new Google reviewers, who completed a multiple choice questionnaire on the 3 security determiners we previously selected. Then, we compared their responses to our solution's answers, and calculations followed.

                    Throughout the adventure, my team and I worked with Google employees (specifically engineers and managers from the Android Security Team) and experts in the cybersecurity and AI industries. Contact with Bug Reporters was considered out of scope because of timelines and coordination challenges.

                <p>
                    Android bug reports are not released publically. As such, my team and I used Chromium bug reports because they were open-source and related to the security of Google products. Chromium reports don't follow the same formatting structures as Android reports. Nevertheless, the solution works off Android's reporting portal and uses Chromium report data for AI training with steps in the handoff documentation for switching to Android's reports.

                        I had the pleasure of working with Eddy on a project sponsored by Google's Android Security team. As Project Manager and UI/UX Designer, Eddy demonstrated exceptional leadership and creativity. He kept the team on track by setting achievable milestones and clear deadlines, and ensuring effective communication within the team. His work on UI/UX Design was equally impressive, and he is undoubtedly one of the best designers I've had the privilege of working with. His ability to balance big-picture planning with attention to detail was truly impressive. Eddy's dedication and expertise made a lasting impact, and I have no doubt he'll bring the same energy and talent to any future endeavors.

                        I had the pleasure of working with Eddy on a contracted project with Google's Android Security team. Eddy played a pivotal role as the Product Designer and Project Manager - creating timelines, leading standups, and establishing communication norms. He showed immense amount of thought when designing, implementing, and collaborating on the project, emphasizing ideation and iteration throughout all stages of development. I would love to have the chance to work with Eddy again in the future, I know that he will be an asset to wherever he ends up.

                        Working with Eddy on the Google-sponsored contract was delightful. As our project manager and product designer, Eddy has proven to be an organized and reliable leader willing to get his hands dirty wherever possible. As an outspoken opportunist, Eddy will always gather information about his surroundings and plan for the betterment of the current task, or if needed guide the production with a critical lens towards the bigger picture. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was a key moment in the work that was pivotal to us winning the innovation award, and it was thanks to Eddy who could help steer us in this direction. When we were speaking with our sponsor about the project details, it had been decided that the product would be backend-oriented, thus there was no need to focus on the presentation or frontend development of the product. This, however, meant that the project would not be presentable in any easily understood fashion. Eddy, the outspoken opportunist he is, suggested a presentable version of this in-progress product. For 1 month, part of the team alongside Eddy focused on this development, and by the end of this deadline had created a public-friendly website and demo of the product at hand, carefully crafted to be easily digested by the public while also in line with the Google's theme and standards. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this presentable version of the product, the project attracted more interest in the form of interviews and Q&A sessions. The public was able to understand the project, many questions were asked and new opportunities were made in the AI cybersecurity space because the product was presentable and indicated its meaning clearly. This could not have been done without a strong understanding of design, and the management skills needed to take any work in the direction it needs. Wherever Eddy goes and whatever he does in the future, in the end he will find ways toward success.
