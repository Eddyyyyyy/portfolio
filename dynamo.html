                <p>
                    The transition from high school to college is not easy. Balancing a heavier workload while keeping up with 
                    exercise, friends, and work make it extremely overwhelming for many students. With all this stress, it is 
                    not surprising that students face mental health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem inspired me and my team to create a solution to lift some of the responsibilities off students' 
                    shoulders, so they can focus on enjoying the college experience.

                    Although I had a hand in every aspect of the project, I mainly focused on revising the wireframes to be more consistent, 
                    creating the whole prototype along with its animations, and product branding.

                <p>
                    To jump start our ideas, we looked at what other people have done to address student stress. We decided conduct research on 
                    scheduling, trackers, and to-do list products because organization leads to a simpler and stress-free lifestyle. We found three products, 
                    <i>myHomework</i>, <i>Habit Tracker</i>, and <i>remember the milk</i>. All products come with calendars, lists, progress monitoring, reminders, and an easy to understand 
                    user interface. It is important to note that all products are extremely manual, meaning the user has to input everything. Thus, these products can 
                    be time-consuming to use on a daily basis and even stressful due to the pressure that students are already in.

                <p>
                    We conducted a survey on Freshmen at our university (since it was convienient) and we were interested in 
                    the workload increase from the high school level to the university level. Participants were also asked about 
                    whether they felt stress during their transition to college and how they handled that stress. These questions 
                    matter to us because we needed confirmation that college life was much tougher than high school life. Now that we 
                    have the statistics to back up our project objective, it was time to dive deeper to understand and empathize with 
                    individual students.
