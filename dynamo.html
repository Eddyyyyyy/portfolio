                    The transition from high school to college is not easy. Balancing a heavier workload while keeping up with 
                    exercise, friends, and work make it extremely overwhelming for many students. With all this stress, it is 
                    not surprising that students face mental health issues.

                <p>
                    I collaborated with my team to conduct research on scheduling, trackers, and to-do list products because organization leads to a simpler and stress-free lifestyle. 
                    I found three products, <i>myHomework</i>, <i>Habit Tracker</i>, and <i>remember the milk</i>.

                <p>
                    In the survey I conducted, I was interested in the workload increase from the high school level to the college level. 
                    Participants were also asked about whether they felt stress during their transition to college and how they handled that stress. 
                    Then, it was time to dive deeper to understand and empathize with individual students.

                    I compiled all the user research into personas which I would later use for the user scenarios.

                <p>
                    Using the market and user research, I created two design goals that would meet our stakeholders' needs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Together with my team, I brainstormed product features that meet my two design goals. In the end, we settled on these six key features.

                <img src="img/dynamo/features.png" alt="proposed features of the product" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    The one other feature that I considered was an anonymous chat feature. Although I felt this was a viable feature for students who wish
                    to express their feelings and problems without worry of being identified, it was important to focus on the users themselves. 
                    Since the students we talked to never said anything about going on long rants, this feature was not needed.

                <p>
                    Although I created a site map to guide my team's sketches, it ultimately guided our wireframing due to time constraints.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, me and my teammates neglected to discuss wireframing ground rules. 
                    Due to the varying levels of color and detail, it was difficult for the team to use the personas to simulate usage scenarios.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to the incoming wireframe deadline, I dedicated a couple hours to add consistency to the wireframes. 
                    By removing color and maintaining consistent button and outline styling, I was able to design a set of cohesive screens that can be used to simulate user navigation.

                <p>
                    I simulated our personas' behavior using the wireframe. 
                    By doing this, I was able to visualize what worked and what areas of the product need to be improved upon.

                <p>
                    The persona of Mike had the goal of relaxing while under stress. The product would send Mike a notification 
                    and if he didn't have any break ideas, he would tap the notification and the break ideas page would be pulled up. 
                    Randomizing the break idea would add the element of surprise and suspense, which is greatly appreciated in times of stress.

                <p>
                    The persona of Myra had the goal of managing assignments and events efficiently.
                    She would use the pull from canvas feature so she would be spared the task of manually inputting assignments. 
                    After she adds her other events, she would use the randomize tasks feature. This feature uses user input data to 
                    assign tasks at random to create a workable schedule for the day. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    When we started the prototyping phase, everyone was pretty concerned about the upcoming project deadline.
                    My teammates suggested I take charge of the prototyping while they worked on the final write-up.

                <h2>Onboarding</h2>
                <p>
                    The purpose of onboarding is to gather essential information from users such as their school, classes, and habits as well as developing a good first impression. 
                    Users can go through these screens in the settings when they want to change their answers to these prompts.

                <h2>Scheduling</h2>
                <p>
                    Users can randomize their schedule for the day by interacting with the dice icon. 
                    This is a provided feature because students may not like their initial randomized schedule.
                    I also flushed out the add/pull assignments button interaction by creating another screen.
                    In this new screen, users can add personal events and pull assignments from canvas.

                <p>
                    Another important feature of my product was having the ability to keep track of a user's hours of work and be able to give break ideas.
                    Additionally, I also implemented a minor points system where users can earn badges. This is a way for students to feel more motivated.

                    Although the course didn't allow time for detailed usability testing, I did recieve

                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">Addressing a concern</h1>
                <h2>How would the application create a workable schedule?</h2>
                <p>
                    Along with all the feedback, there was a common concern about the product. 
                    That being the randomization feature. Since tasks don't take the same time to complete, 
                    how would the application produce a workable schedule? 
                    What user input information would be necessary to make it work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned in the Myra persona and the prototype screens that deal with scheduling,
                    students can randomize their tasks for the day by interacting with the dice icon. 
                </p>
                <img src="img/dynamo/userConcerns.png" alt="demo of the randomization function" class="imageSize" />
                <h2>The concern is addressed by flushing out the product more</h2>
                <p>
                    This concern can be addressed if I had flushed out the product's user information inputs
                    more. However, given the time constraints, I didn't dive deep into the topic. 
                    Although the project had ended by the time I had gotten the feedback, 
                    I took it upon myself to address this concern.
                </p>
                <img src="img/dynamo/proposedChange.png" alt="proposed solution to the concern" class="imageSize" />
                <h2>Added a questionaire screen</h2>
                <p>
                    My proposed solution was to implement a questionaire after the user hits the pull button.
                    This provides specific assignment details that the application would need to create a workable schedule.
                    Students are encouraged to give a duration overestimate because it would prevent the product from creating schedules 
                    that make the student rushed.
                </p>

                <h2>The "lone wolf" approach is not the UX Designer way</h2>
                <p>
                    When my teammates gave me task of prototyping the entire application, I jumped at the chance.
                    What I neglected to understand was that the UX process is wired to be highly collaborative. 
                    Because I was working solo, I was not able to catch as many flaws in my designs than if I had been working with others.
                    Going forward, I shall ensure the collaboration of all my teammates during the design process.

                <p>
                    Me and my teammates were thinking of using this course project for our senior capstone project because of the 
                    positive feedback and a need for efficient schedule creation. 
                    I would first conduct usability testing using the prototype, improve upon it, and make the concept idea 
                    into a reality.
