                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">Project Objective.</h1>
                <p>
                    The transition from high school to college is not easy. Balancing a heavier workload while keeping up with 
                    exercise, friends, and work make it extremely overwhelming for many students. With all this stress, it is 
                    not surprising that students face mental health issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This problem inspired me and my team to create a solution to lift some of the responsibilities off students' 
                    shoulders, so they can focus on enjoying the college experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I had a hand in every aspect of the project, I mainly focused on creating personas, revising the wireframes to be more consistent, 
                    simulating user scenarios, and designing the prototype.

                <p>
                    To jump start our ideas, we looked at what other people have done to address student stress. We decided conduct research on 
                    scheduling, trackers, and to-do list products because organization leads to a simpler and stress-free lifestyle. We found three products, 
                    <i>myHomework</i>, <i>Habit Tracker</i>, and <i>remember the milk</i>. All products come with calendars, lists, progress monitoring, reminders, and an easy to understand 
                    user interface. It is important to note that all products are extremely manual, meaning the user has to input everything. Thus, these products can 
                    be time-consuming to use on a daily basis and even stressful due to the pressure that students are already in.

                <img src="img/dynamo/survey.png" alt="survey results graphic" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    We conducted a survey on Freshmen at our university (since it was convienient) and we were interested in 
                    the workload increase from the high school level to the university level. Participants were also asked about 
                    whether they felt stress during their transition to college and how they handled that stress. These questions 
                    matter to us because we needed confirmation that college life was much tougher than high school life. Now that we 
                    have the statistics to back up our project objective, it was time to dive deeper to understand and empathize with 
                    individual students.

                    Referencing market and user research, we brainstormed many product features that would ease the stress of College Freshmen.
                    In the end, we settled on these six.

                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">Site Map.</h1>
                <p>
                    Although we created a site map for the purpose of guiding our sketches, we ultimately went straight to the 
                    wireframing phase since we were short on time. The map was handy for organization because it told us what screens 
                    to create and where in the flow the screen belonged.

                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">Confusing Wireframes.</h1>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we rushed into wireframing and neglected to discuss some 
                    wireframing ground rules. This caused our wireframes to be inconsistent.
                    Many of our screens had color. Other screens did not have color but were overcrowded with words in comparison to the rest.
                    Some even had both color and detail!
                </p>
                <img src="img/dynamo/messyWire.png" alt="our inconsistent wireframes. some have color, detail, and others do not" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    While this may not seem like a problem after we finished all the screens, 
                    it became a disaster when we attempted to use it for our user scenarios. 
                    We couldn't understand what we were doing because it was confusing to simulate the
                    navigation from screen to screen.
                </p>

            <!-- Wireframe solution -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">I Improved the Wireframes.</h1>
                <p>
                    We didn't have enough time to go through and make all the screens workable. There was still a pretty 
                    lengthy write-up for us to complete (since this was a class that required a thorough explaination of every decision). 
                    So, I suggested I would spend a couple hours fixing the wireframes while the rest of the team gets started on the write-up. 
                    That way, we wouldn't miss a deadline.
                </p>
                <img src="img/dynamo/fixedWire.png" alt="the improved wireframes are more consistent and simple" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    Throughout my couple hours of redesigning, I was in constant contact with my team, to ensure that we were all on the same page.
                    For consistency, I made the screens black and white, and used consistent button and outline styling. 
                    Since I wanted to reuse the wireframe's elements in the prototype, I thought ahead as I redesigned each screen.
                    I decided to put the screens within phone mock-ups to make sure that the elements wouldn't be too close to the sides of the actual prototype.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- user scenarios -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="dynamoHeaders">User Scenarios.</h1>
                <p>
                    We simulated our personas' behavior using the wireframe. 
                    By doing this, we were able to visualize what worked and what areas of the product need to be improved upon.
                    We would have loved to create more personas, which would let us do more user scenarios to test the other features of the product.
                    Unfortunately, we had limited time.
                </p>
                <img src="img/dynamo/mikeScenario.png" alt="user scenario of mike leo" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    The persona of Mike had the goal of relaxing while under stress. Our product would send Mike a notification 
                    and if he didn't have any break ideas, he would tap the notification and the break ideas page would be pulled up. 
                    Randomizing the break idea would add the element of surprise and suspense, which is greatly appreciated in times of stress.

                <p>
                    The persona of Myra had the goal of managing assignments and events efficiently.
                    She would use the pull from canvas feature so she would be spared the task of manually inputting assignments. 
                    After she adds her other events, she would use the randomize tasks feature. This feature uses artificial intelligence to 
                    assign tasks at random to create a workable schedule for the day.
