                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">Project Objective.</h1>
                <p>
                    Whether or not it was only our experience, we realized that commercials/advertisements
                    around sweets have been on the decline. The last candy commercial that we 
                    saw on the internet was probably Snickers and their "you're not you when you're hungry"
                    campaign. According to Statista Research Department, in 2019, nearly 26 percent of people used ad-blocking services while browsing the internet.
                    That percentage is expected to increase as the years progress which means that more advertisements will fall on deaf ears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although people may welcome candy advertisements, they are forced to use ad-block to fend off the other kinds of advertisements. 
                    It is this dwindling exposure on newly released candy products that inspired us (self-described candy lovers) to create an alternative method of getting
                    the most recent candy news to people who like candy. People who want to try new flavors and want to explore their options. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    “How might we provide the people who like candy the latest candy industry news and facilitate their discovery of new candy products?” 
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Although I had a hand in every aspect of the project, I mainly focused on 
                    brand identity, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. In this project, we did a second iteration of 
                    the prototype due to our usability testing results and I was heavily involved in that as well.
