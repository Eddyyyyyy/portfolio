                <p>
                    I visit Candy-focused SubReddits a lot.
                    Every time I do, I would see Redditors inquiring about their lost candy product after belting out the bits and pieces of information that they remember. 
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/proof.png" alt="this problem exists" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    Other Redditors are curious about their favorite candies and want more information.
                    Sadly, those types of posts typically gain little recognition or are ignored completely because most Redditors don't have the answers.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h2>
                    "How might we provide <u>Candy-loving Redditors</u> the ability to reunite with their forgotten candy products while fulfilling their curiosity of confectionery items?"

                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">Competitive analysis</h1>
                <p>
                    I conducted SWOT analyses on three existing solutions that target a similar audience (candy-lovers). 
                    The three sites include: <i>Candy Industry</i>, <i>Candy Gurus</i>, and <i>Confectionery News</i>.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/marketResearch.png" alt="competitors that we looked at" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    Although candy news sites are niche, they have a loyal following due to having newsletters. 
                    However, some sites don't feature them prominently and/or without a strong call to action.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- user research -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">75 respondents and 23 interviewees</h1>
                <p>
                    I conducted a survey to get an estimate of the percentage of community members who had forgotten a candy product that they liked.
                    I also wanted to know the percentage of members who liked learning the background behind their favorite candy products.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/pieCharts.png" alt="Survey results" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    After the survey, we interviewed 23 members mostly through messaging. 
                    Although my objective was to understand more about their thirst for candy knowledge and their thoughts on the lack of attention their posts recieve on the Reddit, 
                    I was open to learning more about their motivations such as why they buy candy as well as other hindrances.

                <p>
                    Designing around a solid goal will ensure that we are focused and don't design things that are not needed.

                <img src="img/candyresearcher/goals.png" alt="our design goals" class="imageSize"/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally, my only focus was to address the first design goal.
                    However, after understanding the other painpoints of the Candy Redditors, 
                    I included a second design goal to appeal to more of the community.

                <p>
                    My teammate and I brainstormed product functionality that would address the design goals. 
                    After which, we discussed which to incorporate into the product. 
                    Decisions were based on feasibility, risk assessment, and practicality.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/featuresBrainstorm.png" alt="proposed features for the product" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    The product's main features include providing users the latest 
                    candy industry news through various forms of media (articles, videos, top ten lists) 
                    and a search tool that would provide accurate results even if a vague description is the input.

                <p>
                    I created a site map as a guide when I sketched the pages of the site. This ensured that I didn't 
                    leave out any features and gives me a road map of pages to create.

                <p>
                    To ensure the solution's user-friendliness, I presented the wireframes to five Candy Redditors to receive feedback before I started prototyping. 
                    There were two design choices that were less favored.
                </p>

                <h2>Annoying accordions</h2>
                <p>
                    4/5 people didn't like the usage of accordions on the top five list because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It hides important information such as product name, rank, and image.</li>
                    <li>Accordions seem too overwhelming for someone who just landed on the site.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/homeWire.png" alt="top five candies dropdowns on home page wireframe" class="imageSize"/>

                <h2>Boring article layouts</h2>
                <p>
                    3/5 people were unsatisfied with the article layout because: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing seemed interesting to interact with.</li>
                    <li>There was a lot of reading before getting to the article itself.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/newsWire.png" alt="article layout on news page wireframe" class="imageSize"/>

            <!-- Get Inspired -->
            <div class="caseSection" id="challenge">
                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">The Challenge: Design-block</h1>
                <p>
                    I had 2 tasks. I needed to redesign the top five list in a space-efficient manner while not overloading users on information. 
                    I also needed to make the article layout more lively and interesting.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/designBlockOne.png" alt="we were stuck on how to design" class="imageSize"/>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/designBlockTwo.png" alt="we were stuck on how to design" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    However, after various attempts,
                    I struggled to find a suitable solution and me and my teammate were stuck (design-block).
                    That was until I started looking at how existing products implemented their features.
                </p>
                <h2>A simplified list design</h2>
                <p>
                    I considered many list designs and settled on Billboard's "The Hot 100" list because of good space-usage 
                    and information hierarchy in that users will see the rank first, followed by the images, and finally the product name and company. 
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/listDesign.png" alt="our new list design was inspired by billboard.com" class="imageSize"/>
                <h2>A livelier article layout</h2>
                <p>
                    The article layout of Eater was chosen because it fits the needs of our users. 
                    Eater features popular articles by having their thumbnails enlarged to empathize significance. 
                    The lack of a detailed description allows users to focus on the headlines, which Candy Redditors were heavily in favor of.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/articleLayout.png" alt="our new article layout was inspired by eater.com" class="imageSize"/>
            </div>     
            
            <!-- prototype -->
            <div class="caseSection" id="finalDesigns">
                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">Prototype</h1>
                <h2>Homepage</h2>
                <p>
                    Upon landing on the site, Candy Redditors will see a carousel whose first slide is a newsletter call to action. 
                    I also made use of the awkward white space on the right side of the top five list. I filled it with a blurb that 
                    gave credibility to the list. Below that, an illustration was used to add more visual appeal to the page.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/protoHome.png" alt="prototype of site homepage" class="imageSize"/>

                <h2>News page</h2>
                <p>
                    The top portion of the news page has an assortment of tags that people can use to filter through the articles.
                    Some article thumbnails are larger to indicate their importance as well as to generate interest.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/protoNews.png" alt="prototype of site news page" class="imageSize"/>

                <h2>Article page</h2>
                <p>
                    Although the page is filled with stand-in content, the idea is that 
                    the length of the article wouldn't be too long. Longer articles decrease user attention. 
                    I also added some cards (above the comment section) displaying 
                    healthier options to meet Candy Redditor's needs.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/protoArticle.png" alt="prototype of site article page" class="imageSize"/>

                <h2>Candy search page</h2>
                <p>
                    Interacting with the search bar or the "Candy Search Tool" banner on the homepage 
                    would bring the user to the candy search tool. If users do not have an idea of the type of candy they 
                    are looking for, then they can start with using the filters to explore. If they need it, there are 
                    advanced filters that take in bits and pieces of information.
                </p>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/protosearch.png" alt="prototype of site search page" class="imageSize"/>

                <h2>Candy product information page</h2>
                <p>
                    If a particular product is featured on the top five list, an article, or the search tool results, the user would come across this page.
                    The purpose is to provide users with additional information about a 
                    candy product such as, history, nearest and cheapest places to buy it from, and articles/videos where the candy was mentioned.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On completion of the prototype, my teammate and I conducted usability testing with several Candy Redditors and other people who like candy.

                <p>
                    A common critique was accessing the candy search tool. 
                    It was not enough to have an entry through the "candy search tool" banner on the homepage and a search bar in the navigation. 
                    Thus, a fourth tab was implemented on the navigation.

                    After usability testing, the project was put on hold. 
                    However, if the project does resume, I would conduct more testing to ensure the current prototype isn't outdated. 
                    After that, I would need to flush out the smaller details such as user log out, user location, and a no relevant search results screen.

                    By gathering design inspiration from existing web-products, I was able to find a solution that works for me and adapt it into my project.
