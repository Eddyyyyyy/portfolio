                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">Project Objective.</h1>
                <p>
                    Whether or not it was only in our experience, we realized that advertisements
                    regarding sweets have been on the decline. The last candy campaign that we 
                    saw on the internet was probably Snickers and their "you're not you when you're hungry" series.
                    This means that people can only be made aware of new relases when they see them in stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is this dwindling exposure on newly released candy products that inspired us (candy lovers) to create an alternative method of getting
                    the most recent candy industry news to people who like candy. People who want to try new flavors and want to explore their options. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    “How might we provide the people who like candy the latest candy industry news and facilitate their discovery of new candy products?” 
                </h2>

                <p>
                    Although I had a hand in every aspect of the project, I mainly focused on 
                    brand identity, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. In this project, we did a second iteration of 
                    the prototype due to our usability testing results and I was heavily involved in that as well.

                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">Competitive Analysis.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before starting user research, we needed to see what the current market looks like. In our case, products that provide candy news to 
                    people who like candy. We identified and conducted SWOT analysis on three competitors: Candy Industry, Candy Gurus, and Confectionery News.
                </p>

                <h2>What we learned.</h2>
                <p>
                    Candy news sites are extremely niche since they are catered to a specific audience (people who enjoy candy). 
                    This is a major weakness because larger news agencies such as Business Insider can easily overshadow these sites.
                    Therefore, directing people to subscribe to newsletters is essential to building a loyal following and reminding people that the site is still alive.
                    We also noticed a lack of user engagement in the articles due to few user comments despite a ton of web traffic.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- user research -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">User Research.</h1>
                <p>
                    Although we want to cater towards people who like candy,
                    we don't know much about them. For example, what are their
                    behaviors and motivations when dealing with candy? What hinders their
                    enjoyment of candy? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, before we start answering those questions, we must find these 
                    people who say they enjoy candy. Thus we sent surveys to relevant Reddit communities (r/candy and r/chocolate).
                    We chose Reddit communities because of the high concentration of people who most likely enjoy candy. The two
                    main traits we were looking for were as follows: Were they willing to try new flavors? Did they stay updated 
                    with new candy releases?
                </p>
                <h2>With just 2 posts, we now had 75 respondents to our survey!</h2>
                <img src="img/candyresearcher/pieCharts.png" alt="Survey results: 57 percent like staying updated on new flavors and 89 percent like trying new candy" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    With over half the respondents meeting our criteria, we moved forward with interviews to understand candy enjoyers at
                    a deeper level. After reaching out to people, we ended up interviewing 23 people in various ways. Mostly through messaging and 
                    some on Zoom call. Below are the summarized interview results.
                </p>
                <h2>Why buy candy?</h2>

                <h1 class="researcherHeaders">User Personas.</h1>
                <p>
                    We created three personas from our user research.
                    Although we included age, family, and location in our personas, they were merely for constructing a character that would make sense and 
                    were in no way reflective of the interviewees (we never asked). Rather, our personas reflected the goals/desires of the people who we interviewed.
