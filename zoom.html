                <h1>My Dilemma.</h1>
                <p>
                    Recently, I went to a drop-in office hour to get help from a TA (Teaching Assistant). I remember being in the waiting room for a long time. Although other drop-in office hours were open, I was hesitant to leave the waiting room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was hesitant to leave because I convinced myself that I was near the front of the line. As such, if I wait a bit longer, I would likely be admitted. On the other hand, If I left, I would have wasted time. Plus, there was no guarantee the other TA waiting rooms were not crowded, which meant I have to spend more time waiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    “How might I make the waiting room more tolerable during crowded drop-in hours?”
                </h2>
            </div>

            <!-- ux process -->
            <div class="caseSection">

                <img src="img/zoom/zoomProcess.png" alt="my user experience process for this project" class="imageSize" />

            <!-- understand -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1>Why the current waiting room is bad.</h1>
                <img src="img/zoom/original.png" alt="current zoom waiting room" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    How many people before me? How long will I have to wait? These questions do not get answered, so I am stuck in the waiting room hesitant to leave.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- user research -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1>17 others agree with me.</h1>
                <p>
                    I interviewed 17 classmates and other people who partake in crowded drop-in office hours/meetings. I then summarized the results.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The waiting room adds pressure to students whose stress levels are already high. By spending a lot of time waiting, students fear they will never get the help they need to succeed in class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students want to make decisions (stay and wait or go to another room). However, the current waiting room makes these decisions difficult because students lack the necessary information.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

                <h1>Checking for existing solutions.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before I started designing, I wanted to be sure there was no existing solution that would give drop-in office hour attendees the information to make decisions in the waiting room.
                </p>
                <img src="img/zoom/researchProgress.png" alt="doing research on the zoom software" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    However, after extensive exploration of the internet and the software itself, I came to the conclusion that there were no settings or hidden features that Zoom has that would address the problem.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- proposed solution -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1>Proposed Solution.</h1>
                <p>
                    Modify the participant's view of the waiting room to show the number of people in the waiting room and the participant's place in the queue while keeping all participants anonymous.
                </p>
            </div>

                <img src="img/zoom/sketch.png" alt="sketches of a better zoom waiting room" class="imageSize"/>
            </div>

            <!-- wireframe -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1>Wireframing.</h1>
                <div class="wireframeScreens">
                    <img src="img/zoom/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe of new zoom waiting room tab one" class="imageSize"/>
                    <p>
                        I chose to use a toggle bar to separate the meeting messages and participants because during my exploration of the Zoom software, I noticed that the toggle bar was frequently used to keep two different functions separated.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="wireframeScreens">

                    <p>
                        New waiting room concept uses the toggle bar to display the number of participants in the waiting room. Additionally, there is also a visual representation of the queue and a participant's place in line. Anonymity is also maintained.

                <p>
                    So, what did other students think about my modifications to Zoom’s waiting room?
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    “Definitely solves my anxiety.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is more than enough and makes the waiting room much more endurable.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Now that it (the waiting room) is usable in drop-in meetings, perhaps hosts would use it rather than trying to avoid it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is great! I can finally feel good about leaving a waiting room.”
                </p>

            <!-- takeaways -->

                <h1>Takeaways.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before designing a solution for a product, check for an existing solution. Although other people and I have the same problem, we may have overlooked hidden settings that offer a solution. If that were true, my priority would be to redesign that setting to be more noticeable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though my research of the Zoom app showed no existing solution, knowing more about the product helped me create a solution consistent with existing design choices (such as usage of the toggle bar).
                </p>
