                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">My Dilemma.</h1>
                <p>
                    Recently, I went to a drop-in office hour to get help from a TA (Teaching Assistant). I remember being in the waiting room for a long time. Although other drop-in office hours were open, I was hesitant to leave the waiting room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was hesitant to leave because I convinced myself that I was near the front of the line. As such, if I wait a bit longer, I would likely be admitted. On the other hand, If I left, I would have wasted time. Plus, there was no guarantee the other TA waiting rooms were not crowded, which meant I have to spend more time waiting.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    “How might I make the waiting room more tolerable during crowded drop-in hours?”
                </h2>
            </div>

            <!-- ux process -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">The Process.</h1>
                <img src="img/zoom/zoomProcess.png" alt="my user experience process for this project" class="imageSize" />
            </div>

            <!-- understand -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Why the current waiting room is bad.</h1>
                <img src="img/zoom/original.png" alt="current zoom waiting room" class="imageSize" />
                <p>
                    How many people before me? How long will I have to wait? These questions do not get answered, so I am stuck in the waiting room hesitant to leave.
                    Unfortunately, during that long wait, I may want to go to the bathroom, get some food, or take a walk to clear my mind a bit. Since I convinced myself
                    that I would be next, I don't do any of those things and I would sit for hours.
                </p>

            <!-- user research -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">17 others agree with me.</h1>
                <p>
                    I interviewed 17 classmates and friends who have been in crowded drop-in office hours/meetings. I conducted these thirty minute interviews over text message as I waited in waiting rooms, 
                    which puts into perspective the long waiting times. 
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        The waiting room adds pressure to students whose stress levels are already high. By spending a lot of time waiting, students fear they will never get the help they need to succeed in class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Students want to make decisions (stay and wait or go to another room). However, the current waiting room makes these decisions difficult because students lack the necessary information.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <!-- research of zoom -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Checking for existing solutions.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before I started designing, I needed to be sure there was no existing solutions. This step is important because designing a new solution when a potential solution already exists would not be an 
                    efficient use of time. If a solution does exist, then my objective would shift to making that existing solution more discoverable since it was clear that me and 17 other people didn't know about it.
                </p>
                <img src="img/zoom/researchProgress.png" alt="doing research on the zoom software" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    However, after extensive exploration of the internet and the software itself, I came to the conclusion that there were no settings or hidden features that Zoom has that would address the problem.
                    Although there was no existing solution, the time I spent conducting the research was not wasted. I learned a lot more about Zoom's design choices such as toggle bars rather than the placement of
                    two buttons side by side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- proposed solution -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Proposed Solution.</h1>
                <p>
                    Modify the participant's view of the waiting room to show the number of people in the waiting room and the participant's place in the queue while keeping all participants anonymous.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- sketching -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Sketching.</h1>
                <img src="img/zoom/sketch.png" alt="sketches of a better zoom waiting room" class="imageSize"/>
                <p>
                    After brainstorming a few potential solutions, I settled on option three because it did not give the user too much information at once.
                    As seen in the sketch I initially considered placing the letter "A" (which would stand for annonymous) in the profile picture.
                    But after some consideration I changed it to question marks due to the possiblity of a person's name that may start with "A". 
                    I wanted the placeholders to be as distinct from the user's personal profile picture as possible. The same logic applied to the name of the placeholder.
                    It maybe unlikely, but a person maybe named Anonymous (for whatever reason in not judging). Using numbers for the name is a safe bet.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- wireframe -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Wireframing.</h1>
                <div class="wireframeScreens">
                    <img src="img/zoom/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe of new zoom waiting room tab one" class="imageSize"/>
                    <p>
                        I chose to use a toggle bar to separate the meeting messages and participants because during my exploration of the Zoom software, I noticed that the toggle bar was frequently used to keep two different functions separated.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="wireframeScreens">

                    <p>
                        New waiting room concept uses the toggle bar to display the number of participants in the waiting room. Additionally, there is also a visual representation of the queue and a participant's place in line. Anonymity is also maintained.

                    So, what did other students think about my modifications to Zoom's waiting room?

                <br />
                <p>
                    Person 1: 
                    <br />
                    “Definitely solves my anxiety.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Person 2: 
                    <br />
                    “This is more than enough and makes the waiting room much more endurable.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Person 3: 
                    <br />
                    “Now that it (the waiting room) is usable in drop-in meetings, perhaps hosts would use it rather than trying to avoid it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Person 4: 
                    <br />
                    “This is great! I can finally feel good about leaving a waiting room.”
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- takeaways -->
            <div class="caseSection">
                <h1 class="zoomHeaders">Takeaways.</h1>
                <p>
                    Before designing a solution for a product, check for an existing solution. Although other people and I have the same problem, we may have overlooked hidden settings that offer a solution. If that were true, my priority would be to redesign that setting to be more noticeable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even though my research of the Zoom app showed no existing solution, knowing more about the product helped me create a solution consistent with existing design choices (such as usage of the toggle bar).
