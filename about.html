                <p>
                    Hey there, my name is Eddy Peng, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington. I am majoring in Informatics (Human-computer interaction) and minoring in Art history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in business, research, psychology, and design. So, when I discovered the UX field during my senior year of high school, I knew that it was the right career for me. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Art History has taught me the importance of function in contrast to form. Therefore, I am able to design simple yet efficient products that makes people happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On my free time, I like to photograph clouds and architecture.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="selfPhoto">
                <img src="img/eddy.JPEG" alt="eddy's high school senior photo"/>
            </div>

            <div class="values">
                <h1>My Values.</h1>

                <h2><mark>Respectfulness towards peers and their ideas.</mark></h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has their own personal perspectives, experiences, and ideas. However, we are unable to read each others minds to determine what they are thinking. Keeping this in mind, I give other peoples' ideas the time to shine by listening and admiring them for their experiences.
                </p>

                <h2><mark>Its okay to make mistakes.</mark></h2>
                <p>
                    We humans often make mistakes as it is part of our nature. However, it is okay. By making mistakes, it allows us to learn from our mistakes and make it a part of our human experiences and reflect on how we could prevent it from reoccurring later on.
                </p>

                <h2><mark>Self-respect.</mark></h2>
                <p>
                    As a college student, I understand there are areas of expertise where I have little to no knowledge. That will be true for me even after I graduate. With UX design rapidly evolving as a field, there will always be room for growth. By keeping an open mind, I am able to learn from fellow peers and mentors without the fear of feeling insecure.
