            <h1>A bit about myself.</h1>

            <div>
                <p>Hey there, my name is Eddy, and I am a sophomore at the University of Washington majoring in Informatics, with a concentration on Human-Computer Interaction.
                    I always have had an interest in business, research, psychology, and design. As such, when I discovered the UX field in my senior year of high school, I knew it was the right career for me.
                    I am also minoring in Art History. Armed with that knowledge, I emphasize function over form, thus, designing simple but effective solutions that leave people happy.
                    Some of my hobbies include Cloud/Architectural Photography and Art History.

            <div>
                <h1>My Values.</h1>

                <h2>Respect others & their ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    Each one of us has different experiences, perspectives, and ideas. Unfortunately, we are not able to read each other's minds to know what they are thinking. Therefore, we have to make our views known to others through our actions, either through writing or speaking. Every person and their ideas have the right to be heard.
                </p>

                <h2>Be human</h2>
                <p>
                    As humans, we often make mistakes. However, that is ok. By making mistakes, we remind ourselves not to make that mistake again. To do that, we reflect on why it occurred and what steps to take the next time it happens.
                </p>

                <h2>No place for ego</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a college student; I do not know everything there is about UX design. That will be true even after I graduate. Since UX design is a rapidly evolving field, there will always be room for growth. Keep an open mind, ask questions, don't be afraid to look "bad" in front of others.
