                    Hey there, my name is Eddy Peng, and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Washington. I am majoring in Informatics (Human-computer interaction) and minoring in Art history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Art History has taught me the importance of function in contrast to form. Therefore, I can design simple yet efficient products that make people happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am not designing, I take pictures of clouds and analyze the historical context of my favorite works of art!

                <h1>üîé My discovery of UX Design went something like this</h1>
                <img src="img/introToUX.png" alt="How I was introduced to UX Design" class="imageSize"/>
                <h2>Let me explain</h2>
                <p>
                    In my senior year of high school, I took a graphic design course when I noticed an Adobe application called "XD" on the school iMacs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I interpreted the Adobe XD icon as a meme maker since the initials of the application was the laughing expression used in online messages. So when I opened it up, I was pretty confused.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got curious about what the application was for, so I searched it up and found it was a platform for creating website mock-ups. Tutorial after tutorial, I steadily became addicted to using the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then one day, I had the brilliant thought of searching up jobs that used Adobe XD. As you may have guessed, the role of UX Designer popped up.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="theQuestions">
                <h1>‚ù§Ô∏è Why am I passionate about UX?</h1>
                <p>
                    I have always been interested in business, research, psychology, and design. I saw UX Design as a middle ground for all my interests. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realized that as a UX Designer, public speaking, meeting new people, and collaboration would become the norm. Because I am an introvert, I don't do those things often, which (historically speaking) makes me anxious. So, now is the time to do what I have feared and become stronger!
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="values">
                <h1>üòé My values</h1>

                <h2>Respectfulness towards peers and their ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    Everyone has their perspectives, experiences, and ideas. However, we can't read each other's minds to determine their thoughts. Keeping this in mind, I give other peoples' proposals the time to shine by listening and admiring them for their experiences.
                </p>

                <h2>It's okay to make mistakes</h2>
                <p>
                    We humans often make mistakes since it's in our nature. However, it is okay. Making mistakes allows us to learn, make them part of our experience, and reflect on ways to prevent them from reoccurring later on.
                </p>

                <h2>I have much to learn</h2>
                <p>
                    As a college student, I understand there are areas of expertise where I have little to no knowledge. That will be true for me even after I graduate. With UX design rapidly evolving as a field, there will always be room for growth. By keeping an open mind, I can learn from fellow peers and mentors without the fear of feeling insecure.
